<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Rochana, i was brought up in AP. I completed my schooling from BHARATIYA VIDYA BHAVANS SCHOOL, 
   my schooling was done on the principles of DR. K M Munshi, member of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution.
   He was an Indian Independence Movement Activist, Politician, and Writer and he was also a lawyer by profession.
   our school runs with a moto 'let the noble thoughts come to us from every side'.

<p>I am curious about computer and things related to it, since computer is my only friend from childhood. we used to have PC since my father 
  is a computer faculty, so i used to play with my pc all the time also my intrest in this had encouraged me to take a big desion in my life 
  during my intermediate, it led to choose me my school as my college when ever other fellow of mine enrolled in coaching in Jee mains, 
  i then decided that whatever happens i am not going to give up in my computers. From then i was more curious and even more decided to the 
  IP(informatics and practices) Subject and Scored a perfect 100 in my 12th boards, it removed my imposter syndrome and made me more confident 
  ever before. Then i decided to take CSE Branch in the best possible college, by the time i realised jee mains completed and even remaining 
  exams had the similar syllabus and strucure i had only one option at that time it was VIT exam and i did work had for it for 1-2 weeks and 
  yeah gave the exam, by god's grace i was admitted into VIT AP with CSE branch. but the fees was a big challange to me and my family but they
  dont want to discourage me and had risked for me and paid my fees. This incident had set fire in me to complete my engeneering with 
  1 cr CTC, also i decided to start earning in my 3rd year with intership - 1-2 L per month in MICROSOFT

<p>MY dedication and passion in computer science had bought me this far and hope will reach the best heights in the field of computer science
  too be continued.....
